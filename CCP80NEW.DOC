CCP8080.ASM is CCP22Z80 from B1 on the Mississauga RIBBS with
four changes:
1.  Reconverted to 8080 code.
2.  CLS command expunged.
3.  All other built-ins changed to single-letter commands
    (L for list, T for type etc).  Å for erase is changed
    to Q to avoid inadvertent deletions.
4.  To save code space, user nos. above 9 are displayed in hex.


N.B. BUG FIX

If you're having trouble running Submit or Supersub with this
program, try the following;

a) Create a CPM.COM file using sysgen.
b) Using DDT change the follwing memory locations;
    987h to 00
    A01h to 08
    A03h to 08
c) Reboot, and using Sysgen place modified CCP on disk.
